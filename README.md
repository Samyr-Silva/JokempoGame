 ### Overview

"Joguinho Jokempo" is a simple command-line game written in C, where the player competes against the computer in a rock-paper-scissors (jokenpo) game. The program generates the computerâ€™s move randomly and compares it with the player's input to determine the winner.

##

 ### How It Works

The game prompts the player to choose between three options:

0 for PEDRA (Rock)
1 for PAPEL (Paper)
2 for TESOURA (Scissors)
The computer randomly selects one of the three options, and then both the computer's and player's choices are revealed with a dramatic "JO-KEM-PO" countdown. The game then announces the winner or a draw based on the standard rules:

Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cut Paper
Paper covers Rock
